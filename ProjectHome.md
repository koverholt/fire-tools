### 3DSOLID2FDS ###

An AutoCAD Add-On to convert 3DSOLID geometries to FDS &OBST lines. https://sites.google.com/site/jdimyadi/3dsolid2fds

### acad2fds ###

P. Shkleinik Plug-in for AutoCAD to use FDS. Converts geometry and starts calculation. You can install the plugin and it will be integrated into your AutoCAD instance. Via this plugin you can convert your dwg models to **.fds files and execute calculation from AutoCad. After calculation finishes you can view calculation result directly in AutoCAD. http://acad2fds.codeplex.com/**
